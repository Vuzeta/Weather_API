Weather_API
____________________________________________________

#The application was created thanks to Weather API, which disseminates weather data all over the world.
I built the application thanks to a JSON file, which I downloaded with a unique key.

#This application shows 5-day weather in degrees Celsius.
The application also shows the user the icon of the current weather and its description.

#In building the application I used technologies: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Ajax
